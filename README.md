# st-E-Commerce



## Description
this application handles the backend of an E-Commerce website consisting of a database with many tables associated with one another. The routes created allow the user to view, create, edit, and delete data from the database as needed.



## Usage
To use run npm i to install dependencies, then start the server by node server.js to create the database. Once the database has been created run CTRL C to stop the server and run node seeds/index.js. Once the data has been seeded into your database start the server again (node server.js). You can use Insomnia to test out the routes.
